							Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works 
                                                        (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. 
                                                        However, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost

Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, 
and until recent centuries, large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, 
were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities
include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa

A distinction exists between sculpture "in the round", free-standing sculpture such as statues, not 
attached except possibly at the base to any other surface, and the various types of relief, which are at least partly attached to
a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief,
and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief. Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt. Relief is the usual sculptural medium
for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round,
and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, 
and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery, metalwork and jewellery. 
Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.</p>
