							Painting is an important form of visual art, 
                                                        bringing in elements such as drawing, composition, gesture, narration, and abstraction.Paintings can be naturalistic and representational 
                                                        (as in still life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art), emotive 
                                                        (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).
                                                        A portion of the history of painting in both Eastern and Western art is dominated by religious art. Examples of this kind of painting range
                                                        from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery, to Biblical scenes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to scenes from the life of 
                                                        Buddha (or other images of Eastern religious origin).

                                                            Watercolor is a painting method in which the paints are made of pigments suspended in a water-soluble vehicle. The traditional and most

                                                            long traditions. There are various types of watercolors used by artists. Some examples are pan watercolors, liquid watercolors,
                                                            watercolor brush pens, and watercolor pencils. Watercolor pencils (water-soluble color pencils) may be used either wet or dry

                                                        <p>Gouache is a water-based paint consisting of pigment and other materials designed to be used in an opaque painting method
                                                            Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher,
                                                            and an additional, inert, white pigment such as chalk is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque,
                                                            with greater reflective qualities. Like all water media, it is diluted with water.,Painters such as  This paint is best applied with
