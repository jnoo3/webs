								Music often plays a key role in social events and religious ceremony. The techniques of making music are often transmitted as
                                                                part of a cultural tradition. Music is played in public and private contexts, highlighted at events such as festivals and concerts for 
                                                                various different types of ensembles. Music is used in the production of other media, 
                                                                such as in soundtracks to films, TV shows, operas, and video games.
Listening to music is a common means of entertainment. The culture surrounding music extends into areas of academic study, journalism,
philosophy, psychology, and therapy. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers,
distributors of instruments, accessories, and publishers of sheet music and recordings. Technology facilitating the recording and 
reproduction of music has historically included sheet music, microphones, phonographs, and tape machines,
with playback of digital musics being a common use for MP3 players, CD players, and smartphones.

A subgenre is a subordinate within a genre. In music terms, it is a subcategory of a musical genre that adopts its basic characteristics
, but also has its own set of characteristics that clearly distinguish and set it apart within the genre. A subgenre is also often being referred to as a style of the genre.
The proliferation of popular music in the 20th century has led to over 1,200 definable subgenres of music
A musical composition may be situated in the intersection of two or more genres, sharing characteristics of each parent genre,
and therefore belong to each of them at the same time.Such subgenres are known as fusion genres. Examples of fusion genres include jazz 
fusion, which is a fusion of jazz and rock music, and country rock which is a fusion of country music and rock music.</p>
